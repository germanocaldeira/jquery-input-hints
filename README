 * Hints automatically added to inputs
 *   add class : input_use_hint
 *   add alt tag with hint text
 *
 *
 * make sure two classes are added to css
 *   input.input_hint { color: #888; }
 *   input.input_hint_active { color: #000; }
 *
 *  Notes:
 *   works for text, password and email input types
 *   doesn't overwrite existing classes
 *
 *  Inspiration taken from: http://www.drewnoakes.com/code/javascript/hintTextbox.html
 *   rewrite in jquery, addition of email input type, doesn't overwrite existing css classes
